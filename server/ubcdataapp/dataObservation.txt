Possible Goals: 
1. Check whether an open source project is under certain securitiy vulnerabilities.
2. Check whether an open source project is violating any licence.

SUBMIT BY link github would be easiest. Send to Jongrin Kim

Marking Scheme:
- finding interesting patterns 
- finding interesting patterns 
- Use some cool algorithm
*HINT*
- ask different questions such as “is there any better methods”
- “Is this pattern intriguing?”
- "How can I do better?”

There are three columns:
1. d_r_uuid = open source project id 
- (unique - should be primary key)
DataType: String

The following 3 are d_r_uuid's instance variables.
1.1 dws
DataType: String

1.2 dns
DataType: String

1.3 so
DataType: String

1.1 & 1.2 & 1.3 => some sort of different features/representation that’s in the open source project id

The other 2 columns:
2. version
- the security version that’s used in the particular project
- important because you want to make sure which version a project is using 
	- to check if the version is under certain security vulnerabilities or not
DataType: String

3. license_id
- id of open source license the project complies under
*HINT*
- fewer license a project uses for each project, better it is since there is lower chance of violating that license) 
DataType: Integer (Not sure if it can exceed 2^31)


Observation:
1. Project and its properties:
- The Id of each project is unique (Primary Key)
- Two rows with different d_r_uuid can have the same set of properties.
	- Not sure what can be made of the 3 properties yet.
- A projet can have many properties.

2. Project and Version
- Version helps map the open source project to proper security check
- *KEY* Each project can be assigned to at MOST one version (Attribute)

3. Project and license_id
- Each project with same properties and same version can depend (assgin) to multiple license_id
- license_id indicates the list of license this project has to satisfy.
- Multiple rows with exact same id, properties, and version can have different license_id

Duplicate values that can appear in project with different ids:
- version
- license_id

Sanitization:
- need to remove duplicate row 
	- two rows are considered the same, when all its columns match
